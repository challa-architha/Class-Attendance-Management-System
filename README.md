# Class-Attendance-Management-System
            A Face recognition based attendance system is more secure and time-saving. There are several research papers focusing on only the recognition rate of students. This research focusing on a face recognition based attendance system with getting a less false-positive rate using a threshold to confidence i.e. Euclidean distance value while detecting unknown persons and save their images.

          Compare to other Euclidean distance-based algorithms like Eigen faces and Fisher faces, Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm is better.

          We used Haar cascade for face detection because of their robustness and LBPH algorithm for face recognition.

          We got face recognition rate of students is 77% and its false-positive rate is 28%. This system is recognizing students even when students are wearing glasses or grown a beard. Face Recognition of unknown persons is nearly 60% for both with and without applying threshold value. Its false-positive rate is 14% and 30% with and without applying threshold respectively.
